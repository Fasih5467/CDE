--  SECTION A — GROUP BY & AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS
-- ============================================================

-- Q1.
-- Count the total number of orders placed by each customer.
-- Show customer_id and order_count.
-- Sort by order_count descending.
   
   SELECT customer_id, count(*) as order_count
    FROM sales.orders

   ORDER BY order_count DESC;


-- Q2.
-- For each store, find the total number of orders placed.
-- Show store_id and total_orders.
    SELECT store_id, count(*) as total_orders
    FROM sales.orders
    GROUP BY store_id;


-- Q3.
-- Calculate the net revenue per order.
-- Net revenue formula: SUM( quantity * list_price * (1 - discount) )
-- Show order_id and net_revenue, sorted by net_revenue descending.
-- (Hint: use sales.order_items)
   SELECT order_id, SUM(quantity * list_price * (1 - discount)) AS net_revenue
    FROM sales.order_items
   GROUP BY order_id
   ORDER BY net_revenue DESC;


-- Q4.
-- Find the average list price of products in each category.
-- Show category_id and avg_price (rounded to 2 decimal places).
-- (Hint: use ROUND())
    SELECT category_id, ROUND(AVG(list_price), 2) AS avg_price
     FROM production.products
    GROUP BY category_id;   


-- Q5.
-- Find the total number of orders placed in each year.
-- Show order_year and total_orders, sorted by order_year.
-- (Hint: use YEAR(order_date))
    SELECT YEAR(order_date) AS order_year, COUNT(*) AS total_orders
     FROM sales.orders
    GROUP BY order_year
    ORDER BY order_year;    


-- ============================================================
--  SECTION B — HAVING CLAUSE
-- ============================================================
     
-- Q6.
-- Find customers who have placed MORE than 5 orders in total.
-- Show customer_id and order_count.
    SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) AS order_count
     FROM sales.orders
    GROUP BY customer_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;


-- Q7.
-- Find categories where the AVERAGE list price is greater than $1,500.
-- Show category_id and avg_price.
    SELECT category_id, AVG(list_price) AS avg_price
     FROM production.products
    GROUP BY category_id
    HAVING AVG(list_price) > 1500;


-- Q8.
-- Find customers who placed at least 2 orders in the year 2017.
-- Show customer_id, order_year, and order_count.
    SELECT customer_id, YEAR(order_date) AS order_year, COUNT(*) AS order_count
     FROM sales.orders
    WHERE YEAR(order_date) = 2017
    GROUP BY customer_id, order_year
    HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2;


-- ============================================================
--  SECTION C — SUBQUERIES
-- ============================================================

-- Q9.
-- Find all orders placed by customers who live in 'Houston'.
-- Use a subquery to get the customer_ids first.
-- Show all columns from sales.orders.

-- Q10.
-- Find all products whose list_price is greater than the
-- AVERAGE list_price of ALL products.
-- Show product_name and list_price.
SELECT product_name, list_price
  FROM production.products
 WHERE list_price > (
     SELECT AVG(list_price)
       FROM production.products
 );


-- Q11.
-- Find all products that belong to the category 'Mountain Bikes'
-- or 'Road Bikes'. Use a subquery on production.categories.
-- Show product_name and list_price.
SELECT product_name, list_price
  FROM production.products
 WHERE category_id IN (
     SELECT category_id
       FROM production.categories
      WHERE category_name IN ('Mountain Bikes', 'Road Bikes')
 );


-- Q12.
-- Find all customers who have NEVER placed an order.
-- Show customer_id, first_name, and last_name.
-- (Hint: use NOT IN with a subquery on sales.orders)

SELECT customer_id, first_name, last_name
  FROM sales.customers
 WHERE customer_id NOT IN (
     SELECT DISTINCT customer_id
       FROM sales.orders
 );


-- ============================================================
--  SECTION D — JOINs WITH GROUP BY
-- ============================================================

-- Q13.
-- Find the total number of orders per city (customer's city).
-- Join sales.orders with sales.customers.
-- Show city and total_orders, sorted by total_orders descending.
SELECT c.city, COUNT(*) AS total_orders
  FROM sales.orders o
  JOIN sales.customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
 GROUP BY c.city
 ORDER BY total_orders DESC;


-- Q14.
-- For each staff member, count how many orders they handled.
-- Join sales.orders with sales.staffs.
-- Show staff full name (first_name + ' ' + last_name) as staff_name
-- and order_count, sorted by order_count descending.
   SELECT CONCAT(s.first_name, ' ', s.last_name) AS staff_name, COUNT(*) AS order_count
     FROM sales.orders o
     JOIN sales.staffs s ON o.staff_id = s.staff_id
    GROUP BY s.first_name, s.last_name
    ORDER BY order_count DESC;


-- Q15. (BONUS — Multi-concept)
-- Find customers who have spent more than $10,000 in total.
-- Join sales.customers → sales.orders → sales.order_items.
-- Show customer full name as customer_name and total_spent.
-- Sort by total_spent descending.
-- (Hint: JOIN + GROUP BY + HAVING)

SELECT CONCAT(c.first_name, ' ', c.last_name) AS customer_name, 
       SUM(oi.quantity * oi.list_price * (1 - oi.discount)) AS total_spent
  FROM sales.customers c
  JOIN sales.orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
  JOIN sales.order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
 GROUP BY c.first_name, c.last_name
 HAVING SUM(oi.quantity * oi.list_price * (1 - oi.discount)) > 10000
 ORDER BY total_spent DESC;
